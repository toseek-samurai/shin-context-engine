# Choosing the right reader

For enrolled projects, use Shin first for unfamiliar code, context recovery or
contract discovery, before broad filesystem or other semantic searches. Known paths/symbols use direct reads, rg/jq, IDE tools and tests.
Do not duplicate successful searches. Give narrow delegates paths and evidence;
request fresh discovery only when needed. No per-read calls or usage quotas.

SOURCE follow-ups require the same project and query snapshot. Document paths in
`document_context` are not SOURCE bindings: use authorized ordinary readers for docs
and build files without SOURCE locators. Refusal does not prove a file is absent.
After snapshot mismatch, query the same project once; do not retry the old read.

Select each repository's allowed handle; single-root MCP cannot serve other roots.
Use a verified existing CLI route or authorized direct reads; never guess homes/grants.
Pass real host session IDs only, with the query's request ID for follow-ups.
Missing correlation is unknown. Never infer model identity, success or token savings
from call counts; client token usage and Shin requests measure different things.

## Request attribution

When the tool schema supports it, pass the real current host session ID as
`session_id` on project calls (Codex: read `CODEX_THREAD_ID` from this chat's shell
once). Reuse it across projects in that chat; delegates use their own actual IDs.
Pass `model_id` only when the host explicitly identifies the current model and the
schema supports it; refresh it after a model switch. Do not infer it from a client,
previous turn, default setting, title or process. Omit unknown values. These labels
are caller-reported statistics, not verified model identity or task success. For
read/inspect following a query, also pass its `request_trace.request_id` as
`parent_request_id` when supported. Never persist a chat ID into shared MCP config.
